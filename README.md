If you want to try please add datasetNA.txt and the R file in the same source.

First of all I read the file and fixed something, and then I wrote our method for use my plot methods like barplot, I use only some method they are already written by R developer here is the methods:
plot()
axis()
polygon()
lines()
read.table()
data.frame()
function()
par()
c()
is.null() I did not need to do this method because it is so easy to make.
I added some example for trying methods after create methods, if you want to you can make other example.
