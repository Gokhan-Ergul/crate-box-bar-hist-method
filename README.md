First of all I read the file and fixed something, and then we wrote our method for use our plot methods like barplot, I use only some method they are already written by R developer here is the methods:
plot()
axis()
polygon()
lines()
read.table()
data.frame()
function()
par()
c()
is.null() We did not need to do this method because it is so easy to make.
we added some example for trying methods after create methods, if you want to you can make other example.
